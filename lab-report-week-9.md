## **My grade.sh:**
```
# Create your grading script here

# set -e

rm -rf student-submission
git clone $1 student-submission
GRADE=0

# check if ListExamples.java exists
cd student-submission
if [ -f ListExamples.java ]
then
    echo "ListExamples.java file found"
else
    echo "ListExamples.java file not found"
    echo "Grade is: "$GRADE
    exit 1
fi

cd ..
cp -r lib student-submission/
cp TestListExamples.java student-submission/
cd student-submission
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java

# check that the compile went fine
if [ $? -eq 00 ]
then
    echo "Compilation succeeded"
else
    echo "Compilation failed"
    echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE
    exit 1
fi

java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples

if [ $? -eq 00 ]
then
    GRADE=3
    echo "You passed all the tests!"
    echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE
else
    echo "You failed some tests"
    echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE
fi
```

## **Choose one of the examples you showed in screenshot, and describe a trace of what your `grade.sh` does on that example**
- Chosen Screenshot --> Sample Student Submission 2: https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected

1) **For each line with a command, what its standard output and standard error are for this run, and whether its return code was zero or nonzero**
- ##### *I found the standard outputs by using the '>' redirection syntax, I found the standard errors by using the '2>' redirection syntax, and I used an 'echo $?' to see the return codes for all the commands that were run by the Sample Student Submission 2.*
- ##### *However, the redirection did not redirect everything for the 'git clone', 'echo', and 'java' commands, so I put the standard output based on what was printed on the terminal instead.*

> - For the `rm -rf student-submission` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `git clone $1 student-submission` line, its return code was 0, its standard output was: 
```
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```
> &ensp;&thinsp; &ensp;&thinsp; And its standard error was:
```
Cloning into 'student-submission'...
```

> - For the `echo "ListExamples.java file found"` line, its standard error was nothing, its return code was 0, and its standard output was:
```
ListExamples.java file found
```

> - For the `cd ..` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `cp -r lib student-submission/` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `cp TestListExamples.java student-submission/` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `cd student-submission` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` line, its standard output was nothing, its standard error was also nothing, and its return code was 0.

> - For the `echo "Compilation succeeded"` line, its standard error was nothing, its return code was 0, and its standard output was:
```
Compilation succeeded
```

> - For the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples` line, its standard error was nothing, its return code was 0, and its standard output was:
```
JUnit version 4.13.2
...
Time: 0.014
OK (3 tests)
```

> - For the `echo "You passed all the tests!"` line, its standard error was nothing, its return code was 0, and its standard output was:
```
You passed all the tests!
```

> - For the `echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE` line, its standard error was nothing, its return code was 0, and its standard output was:
```
Out of 3, you grade is: 3
```

2) **For each line with an `if` statement, whether the condition was true or false, and why**

> - For the `if [ -f ListExamples.java ]` line, the condition evaluated to true because the `ListExamples.java` file from the sample repository existed

> - For the first `if [ $? -eq 00 ]` line, the condition evaluated to true because the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` returned a 0 exit code

> - For the second `if [ $? -eq 00 ]` line, the condition evaluated to true because the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples` returned a 0 exit code

3) **Indicate each line that does not run (maybe because it is in an `if` branch that doesnâ€™t evaluate, or after an early exit)**

> - The lines that don't run include:

```
echo "ListExamples.java file not found"
echo "Grade is: "$GRADE
exit 1
```

```
echo "Compilation failed"
echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE
exit 1
```

```
echo "You failed some tests"
echo "Out of 3, you grade is: "$GRADE
```
