My grandfather used to go by the name of [Rick][1]. He lived in Las Vegas and had a bad gambling problem, so whenever he had money, he would\

A `for loop` is a loop that does things for you
```
for(int i = 0; i < length; i++) { 
    ...
}
```

    A `while loop` is also a loop that does stuff
    int i = 0;
    while(i < length) {
       ...
    }

Lab 0 Notes:\
Everyone should be able to screenshot their page showing the text they wrote in their index.md

Conduct the following experiment: 
Note that in addition to seeing your file at, e.g, https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/, you can also see it with index.html added to the end of the URL: https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html (Try it!). Add another file to your repository with any name you choose, but end it in the extension .md. Can you use this idea to see that file? 
```
Yes I can. 
```
Write down what you think is happening when you commit a new file. 
```
What I believe is happening is that it is simply creating a more specific path that leads to another file inside the repository "cse-15l-lab-report" 
```
