- less: similar to 'cat' command, except allows you to have all the contents of the file on 1 screen instead of just on the terminal.
- find: recursively lists all the relative paths of the files in a directory and its subdirectories onto the terminal.
- grep: accepts a string argument, in which it searches a file and prints all lines in it that have the given string.
